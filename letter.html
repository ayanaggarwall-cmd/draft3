    <h1>💌 Dear Kashvi,</h1>
    <p class="letter-text">
      On your 16th birthday, I just want to remind you how incredibly special you are.
      Sixteen is not just an age – it’s a beautiful journey into new adventures, dreams, and memories waiting to be made.
      I’m so proud of the amazing person you are becoming, and I can’t wait to see all the wonderful things the future holds for you.
      <br/><br/>
      Here’s to laughter, love, and a lifetime of happiness.
      May this year bring you everything you’ve wished for and more.
      <br/><br/>
      With all my love,<br/>
      Your Best Friend ❤️
